The purpose of the scripts in this folder are to understand what the
origins of rare mutations are. The initial idea is to look at heterozygous
SNPs and then understand the mutation load that is associated with those SNPs.
The theory is that if associated mutations are uniformly associated with
the SNPs then mutations are coming both early and late in differentiation
lineages. If the mutations are more heavily associated with one of the SNPs
then it would seem to be occurring in early less differentiated cells.
