#FERMI
##Fast Extremely Rare Mutation Identification

FERMI is used to identify mutations at an extremely rare frequency.
The program is fully function at the moment, but missing a great deal of 
functionality that will be added in the future to increase useability.

####Future Improvements:
1. Console user input (file locations, call pameters, output locations)
2. Autonomously output R plots
3. Autonomously called shell scripts
4. Autonomous LRS Cluster submission
