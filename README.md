**FERMI**

**Fast Extremely Rare Mutation Identification**

FERMI is used to identify mutations at an extremely rare frequency.
FERMI contains set of tools to analyze unique molecular identifier (UMI) tagged, amplicon captured, genomic DNA sequence data. Tools are included both for rapid identification of variants within amplicon sequencing, and for further analysis of patterns and trends within the identified variant pool.

With growing interest in monitoring mutational processes in normal tissues, tumor heterogeneity, and cancer evolution under therapy, the ability to accurately and economically detect ultra-rare mutations is becoming increasingly important. However, this capability has often been compromised by significant sequencing, PCR and DNA preparation error rates. I developed FERMI (Fast Extremely Rare Mutation Identification) - a novel method designed to eliminate the majority of these sequencing and library-preparation errors in order to significantly improve rare somatic mutation detection. This method leverages barcoded targeting probes to capture and sequence DNA of interest with single copy resolution. The variant calls from the barcoded sequencing data are then further filtered in a position-dependent fashion against an adaptive, context-aware null model in order to distinguish true variants. As a proof of principle, I employ FERMI to probe bone marrow biopsies from leukemia patients, and show that rare mutations and clonal evolution can be tracked throughout cancer treatment, including during historically intractable periods like minimum residual disease. Importantly, FERMI is able to accurately detect nascent clonal expansions within leukemias in a manner that may facilitate the early detection and characterization of cancer relapse
