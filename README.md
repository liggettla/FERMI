**FERMI**

**Fast Extremely Rare Mutation Identification**

FERMI is used to identify mutations at an extremely rare frequency.
FERMI contains set of tools to analyze unique molecular identifier (UMI) tagged, amplicon captured, genomic DNA sequence data. Tools are included both for rapid identification of variants within amplicon sequencing, and for further analysis of patterns and trends within the identified variant pool.
