#FERMI
##Fast Extremely Rare Mutation Identification

FERMI is used to identify mutations at an extremely rare frequency.
The program is fully function at the moment, but missing a great deal of 
functionality that will be added in the future to increase useability.

####Usage on Unix no Github:
1. wget https://github.com/liggettla/FERMI/archive/v1.5.0.tar.gz (replace version with desired version)
2. Unzip: `tar xvzf liggettla-FERMI*`
3. Change into the main script directory: `cd liggettla-FERMI*`
4. Run the program: `python2 main.py`

####Usage on Unix with Github:
1. `git clone https://github.com/liggettla/FERMI`
2. `cd ./FERMI`
3. `python2 run.py`

####Future Improvements:
1. Better console input using flags
2. Autonomously output R plots
